# RMRK js packages monorepo

A collection of typescript and frontend packages for working with [RMRK EVM NFTs](https://https://evm.rmrk.app).

In this way, we could help display RMRK NFT on classical NFT marketplace like Opensea.

> Note: Do not try to update `next.js` version, it's confirmed that `next@^13.4` will cause a constant object in `@pixi/core` become empty after `npm run build`.
